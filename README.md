A little work I did for terminal application with Node JS.
----------------------------------------------------------
Used technologies/Library: 
- node-nmap
- readline-sync
---------------------------------------------------------
With this script:
- You can do nmap scans or use them ready-made.
- For now, you can view the ARP table for Windows and the names of users in the public network.
- You can ping and control the device.
---------------------------------------------------------
For the libraries to use, inside the folder type in terminal:
npm install
